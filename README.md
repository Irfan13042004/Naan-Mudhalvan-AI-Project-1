# Naan-Mudhalvan-AI-Project-1
Plant Disease Detection is a Python-based application for automatically detecting diseases in plants using machine learning techniques. The application takes images of plant leaves as input and classifies them as healthy or diseased, along with identifying the specific type of disease if applicable.

## Features
- Automatic detection of plant diseases from images
- Classification into healthy or diseased categories
- Identification of specific disease types (where applicable)
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Real-time processing for rapid diagnosis
- High accuracy and reliability through machine learning models
